to explain TwistedIntegers, here is an extract from the specification we were given:
>Let us define a new operation on the set of integers in the following way: a ⊗ b = a + b + a · b, where
a + b and a · b denote standard operations of addition and multiplication of integers. Thus, for example,
1⊗1 = 1+ 1+ 1·1 = 3, 2⊗(−3) = 2−3+ 2·(−3) = −7, 3⊗5 = 3+ 5+ 3·5 = 23

Some examples of how individual tests run, and fulfill the specification is contained within the Group Report.pdf

To run the program, either run any of the individual files, or simply:
>\>>>from TwistedInt import TwistedInt

Also bear in mind this programming was written using Python3.

Finally The extension I'm most proud of is the addition of using complex/imaginary numbers, which I spent a good day or so implementing.
